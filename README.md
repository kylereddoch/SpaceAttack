A Space Themed Python Text-Based Game I created for my Python class at SNHU.

### Story

You are an astronaut on the maiden voyage to Mars to conduct scientific research about the atmosphere and environment of the planet. You are suddenly awakened by the alarm system halfway through the journey to Mars. You are both shocked and scared as this is not normal. You get out of your sleeping cubby in the Living Quarters and check the security monitors. You notice there has been a breach in the spaceship by an unidentified lifeform. “OH NO…AN ALIEN!” You think to yourself. Your quick-thinking kicks into overdrive, and you have an idea. There are items around the spaceship that can help you defeat the alien and take back the spacecraft. Find all the items around the ship (7) before encountering the alien and save the ship. Encounter the alien before having all the items, and your ship is doomed!
